we want to have a slider that allows people to select the size of the etch-a-sketch from 1x1 to 64x64 grid.

we want for the user to click down to start drawing on the grid. When they click up they stop drawing.

reach goal: have an option for the user to select rainbow mode, so that they can paint in random colors each pixel they go over.
